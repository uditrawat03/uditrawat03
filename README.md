# 👋 Hi, I'm Udit Rawat
- 💼 12+ years of experience as a result-oriented software engineer, actively involved in building commercially successful products from scratch across the full software development lifecycle.

- 💡 Skilled in full-stack development, with hands-on expertise in backend (PHP, Laravel, MySQL, REST APIs) and frontend (React, Vue.js, Angular) technologies.

- 💳 Experience with payment gateways like Stripe, TrueLayer, Yapily, and PayPal.

- 🔄 Worked in Agile teams using tools like JIRA and others for project tracking and collaboration.

- 🧠 Strong in object-oriented programming, ORMs, and scalable architecture design.

- 🌐 Built, maintained, and scaled multiple web applications and services, including custom IDE tooling, Redis/MySQL GUIs, Git dashboards, and LSP-based developer tools.

- 🤹‍♂️ I love wearing multiple hats, helping across the entire stack — though my core strength lies in engineering robust backend/frontend systems.

- 🔍 Participated in all phases of SDLC — from requirement gathering and architecture to deployment and support.

- ⚡ Fun Fact: I’ve recreated IDE features like tabbed editors, diagnostic squiggles, and GitLens-style commit graphs entirely from scratch!
