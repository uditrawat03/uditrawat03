# 👋 Hi, I'm Udit Rawat

- 🔭 I’m currently working as freelance fullstack developer.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning advanced **LSP internals**, **Monaco-style diagnostics**, and efficient **frontend–backend bridges** in Wails.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on open-source tools for **developer productivity** and **custom IDE tooling**.
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with **Monaco-style diffing**, **real-time LSP integration**, and **Git graph rendering** in Go + React.
- 💬 Ask me about **Go**, **TypeScript**, **React**, **Wails**, **LSP**, or building custom IDEs from scratch.
- 📫 How to reach me: [udit.rawat03@example.com](mailto:udit.rawat03@example.com) or [LinkedIn]([https://linkedin.com/in/your-link](https://www.linkedin.com/in/udit-rawat-498b38111/))
